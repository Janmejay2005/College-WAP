#Algorithm:
Step 1 - Start
Step 2 - Initialize: Declare two variables to store the numbers.
Step 3 - Input: Prompt the user to enter the first number and store it in the first variable.
Step 4 - Input: Prompt the user to enter the second number and store it in the second variable.
Step 5 - Comparison: Compare the two numbers.
Step 6 - Output: If the numbers are equal, print that they are equal; otherwise, print that they are not equal.
Step 7 - End
